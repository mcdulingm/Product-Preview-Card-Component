## My process

I set up the different styles from the style guide provided. I then inspect the sizes each each element to know what my boundries are. I took a mobile first approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm going to continue focusing on improving my SASS/SCSS. There are still a lot of tricks I need to learn before using it in bigger projects.
